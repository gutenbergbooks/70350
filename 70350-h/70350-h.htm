BRAZILIAN PEOPLE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Though the precious metals hidden in the Brazilian soil,
may be never so abundant; though the splendor of its
precious stones, may be never so brilliant; though the crops
which the soil yields to the farmer, may be never so rich:
yet there are, in the Brazilian empire, treasures of a far,
greater importance, and infinitely more necessary to human
happiness. They are the powerful means which this vast
country furnishes for the cure of disease.</p>

<p>Previous to Hahnemann’s discovery, we were ignorant
of a positive method of determining the use of drugs. We
knew that they existed, but we did not know how to use
them; and popular experience, more successful than the
wisdom of the School, had alone picked up a few stray
fragments from the rich harvest which had been abandoned
for want of the proper means of gathering. Providence
at last permitted Hahnemann and his disciples to discover
the method of applying remedies to diseases in a positive
and efficacious manner. The dominion of mere palliatives
is at an end.—Homœopathy, by attacking the cause of disease,
destroys the chronic miasms, which are transmitted
from generation to generation; dries up the fountain-heads
of epidemic and contagious diseases; enables the infant-body,
by a positive hygiene, to resist the deleterious influences
to which it might be exposed in the course of its
existence; and, by preserving human life, which is the
most precious capital of nations and the first element of
their greatness, Homœopathy will insure their prosperity,
provided they adopt it without reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>We admire the bold hunter who skims the sharp points
of the rocks, for the purpose of snatching the down from
the little ones of the eider; the indefatigable diver, who, by
dint of patient toil, succeeds in bringing up the diamond
from the sands of the river, or the pearl from the bosom
of the sea. Should not the people of Brazil sympathise
with the patient and courageous experimenters, who, under
the auspices of Hahnemann, discover a world of wonderful
uses in the neglected products of this country?</p>

<p>The work which we here offer to the Brazilian people, is
not a work of fiction intended to amuse, but a serious work
detailing a series of painful sensations voluntarily endured
by a few devoted men, who were desirous of finding out
the therapeutic uses of the poisonous animals and plants,
the pathogenetic symptoms of which will be found described
in this volume. We shall be amply compensated for the
patience and devotedness which the composition of such
a work requires, by the consciousness that it will do its
share in diminishing the sufferings of mankind.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="illus01" style="max-width: 25em;">

</figure>

<p>We commence the publication of our provings by the
symptoms of the Crotalus Cascavella, not so much on account
of the importance of the symptoms which the poison
of this dangerous reptile produces on the healthy body;
but because the unfortunate experiment which was attempted
a few years ago, on a sick person, offers a fair opportunity
of contrasting the hazardous and uncertain results of a
merely clinical experimentation, with the positive advantages
of Hahnemann’s method of proving.</p>

<p>A popular notion,—and the therapeutics of the Old-School
was gradually built up of such notions,—attributed to the
poison of the crotalus cascavella, the power of curing the
elephantiasis of the Greeks, a malady which, in Brazil,
goes by the name of <i>morphea</i>, or <i>Lazarus’-evil</i>. A disciple
of Hahnemann might have verified this belief without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
difficulty, and without endangering human life. But the
Old-School who does not acknowledge our method of proving,
had to remain in doubt about this curative virtue of
the cascavella, until a patient and physician would be found
sufficiently bold and logical to apply to a frightful disease
a still more frightful remedy. Mariano José Machado, fell
a victim to his heroic attempt, and, by his death, dissipated
the illusory hopes founded on the curative virtue
of the poison of the cascavella. Now what conclusion
shall we draw from this fact? That the practitioner
who advised the attempt, has been imprudent and censureable?
God forbid that we should commit such an act
of injustice. A patient has succumbed to a clinical experiment;
let us honor the heroic courage with which he
braved the serpent’s bite; let us honor the zeal of the
practitioner, who persuaded him to risk a few years of a
loathsome existence for the chance, though uncertain, of a
cure. The unhappy Machado has been saved a few years
of cruel suffering; but what a joy it would have afforded
him and his miserable fellow-sufferers, if the remedy for
their loathsome disease had been known! what a glory it
would have been to the physician who should have conducted
them to the haven of relief!<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>However, a homicide has been committed on this occasion,
and though the perpetrators may be free from blame,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
yet we may justly condemn the deceitful science that has
to resort to such dangerous practices, in order to augment
its resources and enlarge its boundaries. Like unto the vile
poisoner who, when his poisons fail him, resorts to the
stiletto, as a means of gratifying his cupidity or his ambition,
allopathy sacrifices human life, and, like him, will have an
ignominious end. The solemn homicide, which was committed
a few years ago in this capital in the name of science,
may be of use to the world, by hastening the glorious recognition
of the homœopathic healing art, in these distant regions.
If it was permitted as recently as four years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
when the name of Hahnemann was scarcely known in this
country, to kill a man for the purpose of trying a drug, we
venture to say that, at this period, nobody would either dare
to propose or accept such a murderous practice.</p>

<p>It will be seen, in studying the symptoms which we have
obtained from the poison of the crotalus, that there are very
few among them which resemble the tuberculous lepra, and
that this terrible malady will, therefore, have to be cured by
some other means. Fortunately, homœopathy teaches us
the method of discovering a suitable remedy in the place
of the crotalus poison, which we now know has to be abandoned
as a remedy for lepra, and the success which we have
already obtained, enables us to indulge the hope, that the
Brazilian lepra, as well as the elephantiasis of the Arabs,
will soon disappear entirely, under the operation of the
suitable dynamised homœopathic agent.</p>

<p>The crotalus will become a useful adjunct to the lachesis
proved by Doctor Hering; it is my belief that it affects the
organism longer and more thoroughly than the latter, and
will effect many cures which had to remain incomplete under
the use of lachesis.</p>

<p>The serpent from which this poison has been extracted,
was caught in the province of Ceara. In this operation I
was aided by the young practitioner who alone, four years
ago, had protested against the dangerous experiment which
was made in the hospital of the leprous patients, of which he
was at that time chief physician. His noble heart revolted
against the practice of risking human life, for the sake of a
medical doctrine, and, soon after, he imitated the glorious
example which Hahnemann had set him fifty years previous,
by abandoning a lucrative practice, and the direction of two
hospitals. Having first protested against the bite which the
reptile was caused to inflict upon his patient, he now voluntarily
exposed his own life for the purpose of extracting the
poison, which was to be suitably attenuated in order to convert
it into a curative agent. Several drops of the poison
spirted on his face, and might have ended his life, if the
inner corner of the eye had been touched as I first feared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
it was. At this day, when his suspicions have been abundantly
confirmed by the physiological provings, Dr. J. V.
Martins, is one of the firmest adherents of our rising School.
May he live to see the error which he had instinctively
rejected, completely extinguished by the brilliant light of
medical truth.</p>

<p>This terrible serpent is found in the province of Ceara,
whence it was brought to Rio Janeiro. This species generally
attains a length of from four to five feet but the animal
from which the poison was taken for our provings, was three
feet long. Its oval-triangular head one half of which is
provided with shields, shows a round depression in front of
the eyes, which are covered with a large elliptical shield,
serving as a lid. The body is big, conical, its movements
are sluggish; its upper surface is covered with scales, the
dorsal scales being keeled and somewhat lanceolate, the
scales of the tail being quadrangular and smaller. The belly
is provided with one hundred and seventy large transversal
plates; there are twenty-five plates belonging to the tail, the
three first of which are divided in shields. The extremity of
the tail is furnished with seven or eight capsules of the consistence
of parchment which, when agitated, produce a shrill
sound. The color of the crotalus is a yellowish-brown,
much lighter under the belly, with twenty-four or twenty-six
regular long rhomboïdal lines on each side of the back.
When irritated and during the excessive heat, the crotalus
spreads a very fetid musk-like odor. The molar teeth which
are few in number, but long and excessively poisonous, are
inserted in exceedingly dilatable jaws. Every body knows
that the poison of this reptile acts with a frightful intensity;
and it was not without great danger that Doctors Mure and
Martins succeeded in obtaining a few drops of it, by compressing
from the living animal the gland which secretes it.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELAPS. ELAPS VENUSTISSIMUS (SPIX.) VIPERA CORALLINA.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The elaps corallinus is found quite frequently in the
woods all along the coast of Brazil, and its bite is much
dreaded. Its colors are more brilliant and more agreeably
combined than those of any other serpent in Brazil. Its
head is small, covered with large polygonal scales; it swells
behind and is continuous with the neck from which it is
scarcely distinguished as regards size. It has round and
small eyes; the jaws which are little dilatable, are furnished
with sharp teeth accompanied by fangs that rest on the venomous
glands. The body is about two feet and a half in
length; it is round, rather big in proportion to the head, and
terminates in a sharp tail. The upper part is covered with
smooth rhomboïdal scales; the belly is covered with two
hundred transverse shields; the tail numbers fifty shields,
which are disposed in two parallel rows. Its colors are disposed
in the shape of rings of a vermillion-red, alternating
with black rings, each two rings being separated by circular
lines of a greenish white. The upper part of the head is
black; likewise the first colored ring of the neck; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
shields of the jaws are white, and are separated from each other
by black lines. As in the case of the crotalus cascavella, the
poison was taken from the living reptile, not without danger.</p>

<p>As soon as I had determined to institute provings with the
poison of the cobra-coral, several of these reptiles were, at
my request, brought to me on the same day, so frequent are
they in the forests of Sahy. The animal which I selected
was wrapt up in a piece of linen-cloth, and, after its head
had been steadied with a little wooden pin, some eight or ten
drops of poison were pressed out of its jaws by means of a
pair of steel-pincers, which I received on one hundred
grains of sugar of milk, and at once subjected to the process
of trituration in my mechanical mortar. They received six
thousand successive turns. One grain of this mass was triturated
a second time, and a grain of this second trituration a
third time, each receiving three thousand turns.</p>

<p>Even while triturating the drug in my mortar, the most
striking effects were produced by the simple emanations
ascending from it. This phenomenon, however, is observed
whenever I cause a somewhat active drug to be triturated
in the mortar.</p>

<p>The symptoms which I have collected, are not a great
many, but they can be depended upon. Most of the symptoms
were experienced by several provers, and some of them
have already been confirmed by treatment, among which may
be mentioned the oppression in going up-stairs, the vesicular
eruption on the feet and the deafness. This last symptom is
of great importance on account of its being so obstinate. For
pulmonary affections the poison of the cobral may likewise
prove a valuable remedy, especially for the second stage of
phthisis, characterised by bloody cough and derangement of
the digestive functions. It may likewise be serviceable in
mental alienation and cutaneous eruptions.</p>

<p>The special action which this poison seems to exercise
on the right side, the paralysis, the lancinations, have appeared
to me worthy of attention. The gyratory motions,
the desire to move to and fro, the scaling off of the epidermis
and several symptoms relating to the disposition and the mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
seem to deserve the attention of the philosophical physician.</p>

<p>There certainly exist remarkable analogies between the
symptoms of the cobral and those of the lachesis. The differences,
however, are sufficiently numerous to refute the
doctrine that all serpent-poisons act almost alike and that the
cobral, for instance, may be resorted to as a perfect succedaneum
of the lachesis. I am convinced of the contrary to
such an extent that it is my belief that the poison of serpents
alone would, if sufficiently proved, furnish the safest and most
rapid means of combating all human infirmities. Every epoch
in the history of the world is undoubtedly possessed of therapeutic
means which are more particularly homœopathic to
the general character of the ruling maladies. Hence it is
probable that when the human species shall have been freed
from the miasms which now undermine its vitality, the simple
flowers on the fields will be sufficient to control the remaining
indispositions. Whereas we, unfortunate heirs of the
chronic miasms of all ages, lepra, scrofula, syphilis and a host
of other subtle plagues, are compelled to employ the most
frightful agents in order to meet the intensity of our diseases.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to give a description of this
species which is sufficiently known; we shall content ourselves
with indicating the principal characteristics which
distinguish it from the other vermin living on the surface of
the human body. The louse is of an oval form; flattened,
longer than the crab-louse; its head is very small; its
thorax is composed of three not very distinct rings; the
abdomen is all of one piece, rounded off on the sides; it is
ash-colored, whereas the crab-louse is entirely white. The
lice which have been made use of in our provings, were
taken from the head of a healthy child of five years.</p>

<p>Even before undertaking this experiment we expected to
derive from it important results. We entertained the belief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
that nature pointed out to us the louse as a specific for the
hereditary psora, in which belief we were strengthened by
the fact that psorin develops the lice-malady in healthy persons.
And we are now prepared to affirm that we have found
the louse one of the most useful agents in diseases of
children. We offer the following pathogenesis with a sincere
pleasure which none but those who devote themselves
to such patient investigations, can appreciate.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This stag whose forms are extremely fine and graceful,
inhabits the forests of Brazil. Its size is about the same as
that of our stag. Its skin the color of which never changes,
is of a brownish fallow, being rather lighter towards the
abdomen, the posterior part of the thighs and the tail. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
inferior surface of the lower jaw, the part above and below
the eyes, the interior of the ears and the abdomen are white;
a black line encircles the jaws and gradually disappears
under the lower one. The eyes of the guazouti are black,
it has no canine teeth; its mouth, which is very slender,
tapers to a muzzle. The horns which, in every case, are
not very high and extremely regular, are at first straight;
they curve forward in the second year, send forth three antlers,
the anterior being placed about two inches above the
burr, which is turned a little inward, and the other two at
the superior and posterior part of the staff. The horns become
bigger as they grow older, but the number of antlers
remains the same. We triturate the skin, which should be
used fresh and covered with the hair.</p>

</div>

<p>This substance, which has been used for some years past
as manure, is found on the coasts of Patagonia—and principally
on the Lobos Island near the coast of Peru. We have
proved the different varieties of guano, and likewise the crystalline
particles formed by the condensation of ammonical
vapors which rise from the guano in abundance. Our hope
to discover in these crystals a more active normal agent, has
not been realized, so that, in the end, we have found the
freshest possible guano preferable for medicinal purposes.
It is triturated in the same way as all other substances.</p>

<span class="smaller">HIPP. MANCINELLA VENENATA, TUSS.</span></h2>

<p>Although the poisonous properties of the mancinella have
been very much exaggerated, it is nevertheless a very poisonous
tree, which, happily, becomes more and more rare,
owing to its being rooted up with great care wherever it
shows itself. It is a tree from 12 to 15 feet high, with a
trunk having a white and soft wood and covered with a greyish
bark. Its branchy top gives it the appearance of a
European fruit-tree. Its leaves are alternate, oval-acute, somewhat
cordate at their base, with fine indentations, and a red
gland at their apex. They are attached to long petioles;
stipulate while young. Flowers monoïchous, forming long
terminal spikes, the male flowers being above, the female
below or at the axilla of the leaves. The male flowers have
a bifid perianth whence emanate the stamens, the united
filaments of which form a column that supports the anthers.
The female flowers have a perianth with two or three divisions
and a rudimentary foliole; the ovary is round and
superior; style straight, terminating in 6 or 7 red, radiating,
reflexed stigmata. The fruit is round, pulpy, from 5 to 6<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
inches in diameter, umbilicate at the top, and inclosing a
wooden kernel with seven monosperm compartments.</p>

<p>The fresh leaves are triturated. When we were informed
that a mancinella had been discovered near Rio, we requested
Mr. Ackermann, a pupil of the institute, to repair to
the spot for the purpose of verifying the identity of the plant,
and collecting its juice. Having accomplished his mission,
he drunk a portion of the liquid, on the 10th of January,
1847, in a public sitting of the institute. He was joined in
the proving by several of our pupils. Some of the following
symptoms were so violent, that they had to be counteracted
by antidotes. The pathogenesis of the mancinella is one of
the most precious additions which our Brazilian provers have
furnished to our Materia Medica.</p>

<p>This plant inhabits the equatorial regions of South-America,
the provinces of Para, Rio-Negro, and the neighborhood
of the Amazon, where it is very frequent. It resembles the
hura crepitans; its leaves are alternate, somewhat cordate,
rounded, glabrous, serrate; rolled up and stipulate while
young. The petiole is provided at its top with two large
glands. Flowers monoïchous; the male flowers having a
short, urceolate perianth, and covered with a scaly bract;
they form elongated, peduncled, terminal husks. The female
flowers, which are twice as long as those of the hura
crepitans, have their perianth resting against the ovary,
which is surmounted by a long and infundibiliform style,
terminated by a stellate stigma; they are solitary and placed
near the male flowers. It is from this tree that the Indians
draw the milky juice called Assacù by the Brazilians.</p>

<p>A man affected with lepra, and who had sought refuge in
the solitary regions of the Amazone, took, by the advice of
an Indian whom he met there, a considerable quantity of a
juice known under the name of Assacù, flowing from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
trunk of a tree, which has been described by Willdenow,
under the name of hura braziliensis. He was cured; and
the president of the province of Para, informed the imperial
government of it. Since then, this juice has been very
generally used by leprous patients without, however, curing
them.</p>

<p>The first and third provers of this drug, on a voyage to
Brazil, in 1842, had both been attacked with the lepra.
Under homœopathic treatment they seemed both to have got
well, though one might have inferred from the gravity of
their symptoms, that they had been palliated rather than
cured. The frightful symptoms of compression of the spinal
marrow, which supervened in the case of one of the provers,
point to the Assacù as a powerful remedy for various forms
of myelitis. The symptoms of nervous excitement, the
twitching, the irritability of the temperament exhibited by all
the provers, favor the doctrine that the lepra is a particular
lesion of the nervous system. If the exanthems and the
insensibility of the skin characteristic of the lepra, have been
less marked in our provings, it is undoubtedly because these
phenomena belong to some chronic form which a continued
use of the drug and a real poisoning are alone capable of
producing.</p>

<p>These four provings have been instituted with a single
drop of the fifth attenuation. It is our rule to avoid repeating
the dose lest the chronological succession of the symptoms
which we regard as important, should be disturbed. We do
not believe that repeated doses can do much good, and if a
prover should not experience any effects from one dose, we
should prefer dropping this proving, and resort to some other
drug, to which his organism should be more sensible.</p>

<p>This plant is very common in the neighborhood of Rio,
where it is found along the roads and in stony regions. It is
herbaceous, with numerous glabrous, erect stems, attaining a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
height of from twenty to thirty inches; the radical leaves
are petiolate, finely indented; the superior leaves are alternate,
sessile and almost linear. It blossoms in September.
The flowers, which form terminal spikes, are supported by
filiform pedicles; calix with four folioles; corol small, cruciform,
with four hypozynous petals, six tetradynamous stamens,
short style, small, subelliptical pod, which is somewhat
crenated at the top; root fibrous, simple, erect.</p>

<p>The fresh leaves are triturated.</p>

<p>In Brazil the Lepidium bonariense is used for similar purposes
as the Arnica. It is universally used in domestic practice.
The pathogenesis of this plant may be perhaps welcome
to our profession.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOL. T. ÆG.—DISEASED POTATO.</span></h2>

<p>A description of the potato in a work destined for European
pharmaceutists and physicians, would be entirely useless; so
well and so universally known is this plant in Europe.
However, since our work will get into the hands of persons
who are less familiar with the productions of the European
continent, we deem it advisable to subjoin a drawing and a
short description of this plant. The potato is a native of
Chili; it is an herbaceous plant, with a branchy stem about
one or two feet high. Its leaves are pinnatifid, with leaflets
that are oval, entire, slightly hairy on their lower surface and
almost opposite. Smaller folioles sometimes arise between
the larger ones. The flowers constitute corymbs either erect
or inclined; calice in five parts; corol of a white violet with
five equal divisions; five stamens attached to the basis of the
corol; one style and stigma, fleshy berry with two chambers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
The roots develop tubercles of different sizes and called
potatoes. The potato-rot first reveals itself by brown spots
irregularly distributed through the interior of the tubercles;
gradually these spots are transformed into white points of a
cottonny appearance which may be compared to the cryptogamia
termed byssus, and found on damp wood. From this
point a general process of decomposition sets in, and the
potato exhales an insupportable nauseous odor. In our
provings we have made use of a potato in an entire state of
decomposition, without, however, being completely rotten;
there were brown portions intermingled with those byssus-shaped
parts described above.</p>

<h3>HOMŒOPATHIC TREATMENT OF THE POTATO-ROT.</h3>

<p>Human pathology is not the only field of the homœopathist.
He should take an interest in every species of suffering,
and endeavor to restore the harmony of the organic kingdom
wherever it has been disturbed by some accidental cause.
Homœopathy is a vast, unitary science. The healing art is
one; there is no such thing as one healing art for man and
another for the animal, though it is on man that we should
prove our drugs because he is the complex of the various
kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>The question now occurs, how is the potato-rot to be treated?
It is evident that the great point is to <i>prevent</i> the disease,
and, for this purpose, we must endeavor to remove the
cause. <i>Principiis obsta</i>, has ever been the fundamental rule
of medical treatment.</p>

<p>In order to attain this end, we have deemed it necessary
first to ascertain the effects which the diseased potato would
produce on a healthy person and afterwards to find out what
drugs produce similar effects. We might have instituted our
provings on the potato itself, and, among a number of drugs,
might have discovered the one that would produce a disease
similar to the rot. But this mode of investigation would have
been too long and uncertain, whereas the proving on the
human body is simple and direct, and is, we think, the true
mode which Providence has designed we should pursue even
in regard to the potato-rot.</p>

<p>It is true, man cannot be assimilated to the myriads of organized
beings that surround us; man constitutes the highest
link in the chain of beings; he is the complex of the animal
life on our globe, and the most perfect type to which all inferior
existences can be referred; he is a microcosm containing
all the wonders of the universe; he is the responsible
administrator of this earth. Man alone is able to produce a
true pathogenesis by revealing the most evanescent as well
as the most characteristic and most permanent symptoms, or
lesions of sensation. On plants and animals we can only
perceive disordered functions, disorganizations of tissues, or
acute pains as manifested by gestures or cries; but the truly
dynamic action can only be properly perceived and described
by man.</p>

<p>The veterinary homœopathist does very well in selecting
his remedy by the human pathogenesis. Why should not
the same mode be applicable to vegetables? We have invited
our fellow-beings to try it; we have not only invited
them to teach, and to cure, and to make themselves sick, in
order to discover the true means of healing; but we have
encouraged them to suffer themselves to be persecuted, and
even imprisoned, as a reward for their labors of love, we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
said to them; whilst the world is hesitating whether it
should accept or reject the blessing offered by Hahnemann,
let us lose no time; there are other regions where the evil
is still triumphant, and where truth is not even known by
name; let us expel error from its last hiding-places. And
we have never failed in meeting corresponding souls that
would hear us and follow us. And thus it is that homœopathy,
this physical reflex of the Christian redemption, combats
evil by itself, pursuing it from region to region until it
shall have been exterminated from the world.</p>

<p>Now let us describe the practical part of our proving.</p>

<p>From the first, frontal headaches, with pressure above the
orbits, have been observed with much regularity not only by
the three provers whose symptoms are published, but also by
other provers who continued the proving only for a few days.</p>

<p>Until the 20th day, these headaches were often accompanied
by fever, with chill, heat, sweat, shudderings followed
by sore throat, cough and greenish mucous expectoration.</p>

<p>The palpitation of the heart which occurs during the
whole period of the proving, and with particular violence at
the end of the third proving, appears to be represented in
the case of the second prover by violent muscular pulsations
occurring in the same chronological order. The hard, large-sized,
fragmentary stools, and their painful expulsion which
sometimes caused a falling of the rectum; the frequent
emission of flatulence preceded or accompanied by colic,
with sensitiveness of the abdominal integuments in the case
of the first prover, are very constant symptoms of this drug;
they were observed from the first and increased until the last
days of the proving.</p>

<p>We will likewise point to the general or partial weakness,
which, in the case of the third prover, were followed by
violent pains in the loins.</p>

<p>The white coating of the tongue which was observed on
the first day, gradually limited itself to a yellow line along
the middle. Among the less general symptoms which were
observed during the whole time of the proving, we may note
the want of appetite, the bitter taste of food, the cutaneous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
eruptions, the swelling of the mucous membrane of the palate,
the thick urine, and lastly the pain in the groin or the right
ileo-femoral articulation.</p>

<p>In the emotive sphere the drug induced a great irritability.
The dreams about a change of form occurred very generally
to the three provers. The second prover had the same
dreams on two successive nights.</p>

<p>After a careful comparison of the symptoms of the Solanum
tuberosum ægrotans with those of the other known remedies
of our Materia Medica, we have found them to agree with
the symptoms of the following drugs which we enumerate in
the order of their importance:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>Bryonia</i>;</li>
<li>2. <i>Arsenicum</i>;</li>
<li>3. <i>Plumbum</i>;</li>
<li>4. <i>Nux-vomica</i>;</li>
<li>5. <i>Sepia</i>;</li>
<li>6. <i>Strontiana</i>;</li>
<li>7. <i>Viola-tricolor</i>;</li>
<li>8. <i>Squilla</i>;</li>
<li>9. <i>Pulsatilla</i>;</li>
<li>10. <i>Graphites</i>;</li>
<li>11. <i>Alumina</i>;</li>
<li>12. <i>Mercurius</i>;</li>
<li>13. <i>Natrum-mur</i>;</li>
<li>14. <i>Ignatia</i>;</li>
<li>15. <i>Calcarea</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have no doubt that Bryonia and Arsenicum will prevent
the rot; but, to be frank, we believe that, in this case
at least, the isopathic method of treatment will prove more
successful than the homœopathic. It is well known that the
mode of preparing our drugs for medicinal purposes, modifies
their action a good deal. This result is principally obtained
by rubbing them down with sugar of milk, which is not an
inert substance as Hahnemann believed, but is on the contrary
endowed with the most useful powers of action. The
sugar of milk effects a preliminary digestion of the drug, and,
by imparting to it vital qualities, fits it for medicinal purposes.
Do we not know that certain animal products are preferable
to corresponding mineral substances? Is not the calcarea
prepared from the oyster-shell preferable to the chemically
prepared carbonates and phosphates of lime? Are not the
poisons of serpents destined to occupy the first rank among
the polychrests?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>To return to our subject, the medicinal preparation obtained
from the diseased potato is not the original poison as used
by nature, but the poison modified in consequence of its
having been previously engrafted on a living tubercle.</p>

<p>Our mode of inoculating either the isopathic or homœopathic
preparation is as follows. Before putting the potato
in the ground we perforate it with a big needle, and into this
hole we insert a single globule of the third attenuation.</p>

<p>This operation is simple and easy. It can be applied on
a large scale and we think that by its means the potato
will be preserved for a long time yet to the European continent.</p>

<p>This is a creeper, inhabiting the shores in the bay of
Rio Janeiro. Its stem is herbaceous, rounded, covered
with short and rather stiff hairs. Its leaves are simple,
opposite, gradually tapering to a short channelled petiole
adhering to that of the opposite side, and forming tufts at
certain intervals whence arise adventitious roots. They
have a smooth, trapezoid, coarsely intended limb. The
flowers form little axillary heads, with from 15 to 20 flowers
each, arising from an involucre with five divisions and
supported by a somewhat filiform pedicle. Calix tubulous,
monophyllous, with five teeth, and much shorter than the
tube of the corol. The corol is monopetalous, of a yellowish
white, tubulous, puffed up at its extremity, with five reflexed
divisions, and five stamens with bilocular, connivent anthers
which are longer than the corol. Ovary one-celled, flat
at the top, whence proceeds a slender style, terminated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
a glandular stygma which is longer than the stamens. Fruit

<p>The blatta americana, which is very common in Brazil,
where it inhabits human dwellings, is an orthopterous insect,
with an elongated, oval, rather flat body, from 12 to 16 lines
in length, of a brown-red which becomes paler under the
belly. The prothorax is smooth, shining, of an ochre yellow,
with two large brown spots, which are sometimes united in
one. In the male the elytræ reach beyond the belly by a
few lines; in the female they are a little shorter. They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
marked with numerous longitudinal streaks which bifurcate
near the dotted margin terminating the elytræ. The wings
are striate and reticular, of the length of the elytræ. The
antennæ which are longer than the body, exhibit at their
base a small yellowish point. The feet are provided with
black prickles and terminate in a tarsus with five articulations.</p>

<p>We triturate the whole insect, if possible alive, for 15
minutes; after which we take two or three grains of this
paste and rub them down with 100 grains of sugar of milk in
order to obtain the first trituration.</p>

Heat in the urethra when urinating. Stitch as by a fly, in
the corner of the left eye, at 10 in the morning. Sense of
weariness in the bends of the knees. Yellowness of the
face. <b>10.</b> Yellowness of the sclerotica. (When the
prover had the jaundice, for which the blatta is considered
empirically as a specific, he felt a number of pains which
have been reproduced in this proving, such as general
prostration, weariness, &amp;c.) Frequent yawning, watery
discharge from the nose. Lachrymation. Passing bloating
at the pit of the stomach. <b>15.</b> Drowsy in the afternoon.
Acute pains in the temples, every now and then, at 4 in the

<p>The manioca which is cultivated, a good deal in South-America,
for its nutritious root, is a bush with a round
and ramose stem, often growing to the size of three feet
high. Its leaves, which are of a sea-green color, and supported
by long petioles, are alternate, palmate, with five to
seven lanciolate, smooth and entire lobes. The flowers,
which are monoïchous, form branching panicles either terminal
or axillary; their perianth is calicoïd, campanulate,
with five deep divisions of a light-yellow color, changing to
a brown at the extremity of the divisions. Flowers male,
ten stamens, with alternately long and short filaments inserted
in a fleshy disk, which, in the female flowers, surrounds the
base of a sub-globular ovary, with three uni-ovulate chambers;
no style, but three stygmata presenting six or seven
thick, compressed lobes that constitute a thick and sinuous
mass. The roots, which are tuberculous and very big, contain
an abundance of milky juice which is very poisonous
when fresh, and which is extracted first by pressure and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
afterwards by the desiccation of the feculent portion that constitutes
the chief nutriment of the Brazilian farmer. It is this
juice that we employ in medicine.</p>

<p>On the second of July, 1845, a large quantity of this
dangerous liquid was expressed before the institute, and an
ounce of it was taken by Dr. Jo. Vincente Martins, and
several pupils among whom Messrs. Antonio de Souza, Dias
and Chedifer, seemed to be the most eager. The symptoms
were so violent that most of the provers were obliged to antidote
them. We trust that the devotedness of the Brazilian
physicians will excite a corresponding enthusiasm among
their brethren in other parts.</p>

<p>This is a climbing plant, cultivated in America and
Europe. Leaves large, entire, cordate, alternate, on long
petioles, generally arising from the axil of the flower-bearing
branches. Calix with five unequal folioles, the three outer
ones sharp, the two inner ones oval and foliaceous. Corol
white, large expanding into a large circular limb. Stamens
five, adhering by their filaments to the tube of the corol
which is shorter than the stamens. Anthers linear acuminate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
The base of the ovary is surrounded by a glandular disk;
style very long, filiform, terminated by a shaggy, bilobate
stygma; fruit with a coriaceous tegument. There are two
or three flowers on the flower-bearing pedicels; they
resemble a trumpet in shape, whence their Brazilian name
“herva trombetta.” This plant blossoms in the summer-months.

<p>This toad is found all over America; it inhabits swamps
and marshy regions. It is as big as two fists, though its size
varies a good deal. It is readily known by its enormous
rhomboïdal parotids, whence it sends forth a large quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
poison. Its head is flat, triangular, more large than long; it
shows a strong osseous edge, commencing at the tip of the
muzzle, thence stretching towards the inner angle of the eye,
round this organ, and finally terminating behind the lids.
The eye and the tympanic wall are very large. The trunk,
which is very large anteriorly, in consequence of the large
development of the parotides, is covered, on each side of the
dorsal spine, with two irregular rows of large elliptical or
conical bladders; sometimes there are such bladders on the
sides. The anterior extremities do not reach to the end of the
trunk; the posterior extremities reach beyond the muzzle by
the length of the fourth toe. The toes are rather flattened; the
first toe is longer than the second. Its colors are various,
consisting of a number of brown spots, which coalesce on the
back, and are separated on the abdomen by yellowish dots.</p>

<p>The horrible croaking of these animals is well known, and
might rouse the indignation of the most phlegmatic individual.</p>

<p>By exciting the animal, we caused it to spirt its saliva,
which we collected on a little sugar of milk, and at once prepared,
by trituration.</p>

bears the flower-bearing pedicels. Flowers alternate, on
short peduncles, and accompanied by bracts. The corol has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
a double perianth, with three divisions adhering to the triangular,
greenish and glandular ovary; the stamens present
the changing characters so common in this family. We use

<p>This is an herbaceous plant having an aromatic odor, with
an erect and ramose stem, about 16 or 20 inches high; it is
pubescent, quadrangular and grooved towards the upper
branches. Leaves opposite, oval, finely indented, on petioles
of the same length, as the limbs of the leaves. Flowers
whorled, forming terminal spikes; each whorl is provided
with two foliaceous bracts. Calix with five divisions, the
upper being oval, large and entire; the other four are sharp
and inferior. Corol tubulous, inverted, with a bilabiate limb;
the upper lip divided into four lobes; the lower lip composed
of a single lobe, which is longer. Stamens four, with free
and outward-bent filaments, and two other stamens, which are
shorter and somewhat geniculate at their base; style filiform
and bifid. Root vertical, fibrous, rather ramose. We use
the leaves.</p>

<p>The ocimum canum is destined to become one of the most
important remedial agents in Brazil, where it is used as a
specific for the diseases of the kidneys, bladder and urethra.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>

in the hope of facilitating their employment in the treatment
of disease.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> This case has been reported in detail, in the Medical Gazette
of Paris, of the 5th of January, 1839, by the attending physicians,
<i>Maïa</i> and <i>Reis</i>. We transcribe it for the benefit of our readers.</p>

<p>Mariano José Machado, fifty years old, of athletic form, bilious-sanguine
temperament, was afflicted with elephantiasis leontina Alibert.
The whole body, especially the extremities, were insensible. The
skin and the cellular tissue were thickened, hard, rugose and covered
with tubercles which were somewhat raised but not ulcerated. A few
pustules under the arms, looked like itch-pustules, and seemed to indicate
a complication with this disease. The epidermis and nails began
to alter, and the fingers had lost their normal shape. Internally, the
patient felt quite well, enjoying both vigor of mind and body. After
six years of suffering, he had come to the determination to try this
dreadful experiment, which would either lead to death or a deliverance
from his horrible affliction.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth of September, at fifty minutes past
eleven o’clock, he was bit by a rattle-snake, the crotalus cascavella, in
the two last fingers near the metacarpus. He felt neither the bite, nor
the poison as it penetrated into the wound. A few drops of blood
came out of the wound, and the hand began immediately to swell.—In
five minutes: slight feeling of coldness in the hands.—Twelve o’clock:
slight pain in the hollow of the hands.—Twenty minutes: the hand
swells a good deal.—Thirty minutes: swelling of the jugular veins.
Alteration of the features. Formication in the face.—Fifty-five minutes:
the sense of swelling extends through the whole forearm.—Twenty
minutes past one: trembling of the whole body.—Thirty-six minutes
past one: the head is affected, with frequent pulse, difficulty of moving
the lips, disposition to slumber, constriction of the throat, violent pain
in the whole arm, the hand swells more and more.—Thirty-eight
minutes past one: sense of chilliness; the patient covers himself.—Forty-eight
minutes past one: pain in the tongue and larynx, increased
pains and swelling of the bitten hand; sense of coldness in the feet.—Twenty-five
minutes past two: difficulty of swallowing,—anguish,—copious
sweat on the chest.—Fifty minutes: weakness of the arms,—nosebleed,—anguish,
now and then,—restlessness,—pulse 96.—In three
hours and forty minutes: pulse 100.—Fifteen minutes: intensely violent
pains in the arms.—restlessness.—Thirty minutes: pulse 98,—red
face,—continual bleeding of the nose.—Thirty-five minutes: the patient
drinks some wine and water without any difficulty, and changes his linen
which was all wet from the perspiration.—Intense redness all over.—In
four hours: pulse 100,—the whole of the skin, especially on the
bitten arm, is very red,—violent pains in both arms, which do not leave
the patient any rest,—constriction of the throat,—impeded respiration.—Fifty
minutes: pulse 104,—the body is very hot all over,—flow of
saliva.—In five hours, thirty minutes: torpor,—copious emission of
urine,—thick, viscid saliva, which it is difficult to get out of the mouth,—muscular
debility,—frequent moaning on account of the pains which
he feels in the whole body,—quiet breathing,—pulse full and frequent,
skin soft,—the bitten hand swells enormously.—In seven hours: somnolence
with moaning,—after waking the pains in the arms are less,
but he experiences violent pains in the chest,—sensation of a lump in
his throat,—copious emission of urine,—great difficulty of swallowing,
white, viscid saliva,—discharge of a bloody liquid from the nose,—inability
to swallow a drink composed of water, sugar and brandy.—In
eight hours: the sweating abates,—restlessness,—moaning,—emission
of urine.—In nine hours, ten minutes: the moaning ceases,—deep
sleep.—In ten hours: takes an infusion of guaco,—pulse 108,—the
bloody discharge from the nose ceases,—shrivelling of the tuberculous
formations on the arms and in the face, they exhibit an erysipelatous
redness.—In ten hours, twenty minutes: emits two ounces of a natural
urine,—a few minutes’ quiet sleep, without moaning.—In ten hours,
forty minutes: the pains abate a good deal, but he complains of pains
in the thighs and feet, where he had felt a considerable coldness until
now,—pulse 108,—ordinary thirst,—the patient sits up in order to
drink, and swallows the drink with ease.—In eleven hours: takes four
spoonfuls of a strong infusion of guaco.—In eleven hours, forty-five
minutes: emits a deeply-colored urine,—pulse 119,—the bitten hand
and arm are very much inflamed and intensely painful,—restlessness.—In
twelve hours: quiet sleep, disturbed by eructations,—pulse 112,—emission
of urine.—In twelve hours, thirty minutes: restlessness,—screams,—despair.—In
twelve hours, forty minutes: emission of urine,—pulse
116,—sensation of burning heat in the legs, which he uncovers.—In
thirteen hours: emission of urine,—quiet,—he takes an
infusion of guaco.—In fourteen hours: he sits up in bed, and drinks
water, during which he moves about violently and screams.—In fifteen
hours: emission of urine,—the swelling of the lower lips abates,—the
salivation ceases.—In fifteen hours, forty-five minutes: pulse 110,—involuntary
motion of the right thumb and left foot.—In seventeen
hours: the patient feels very sick,—pulse 100,—frequent moaning.—In
nineteen hours: excessive debility,—involuntary motion of the lower
jaw, and lower extremities,—bloody urine.—In twenty hours: accelerated,
intermitting pulse,—increase of the convulsive motions,—the
swelling of the extremities, and the redness of the skin are less,—extreme
difficulty of swallowing,—anxious respiration.—In twenty hours,
fifty minutes: diminution of the convulsive motions.—In twenty hours,
fifty-five minutes: the convulsions cease.—In twenty-one hours: he
takes an ounce of lizard-oil, which he swallows with difficulty.—In twenty-one
hours, thirty minutes: death.—In a few minutes, the blue-colored
body, swoll considerably.—Twenty-three hours after death, the body had
swollen enormously, was covered with blue and red spots, and smelt so
horridly that no post-mortem examination could be made.—<span class="smcap">Hempel.</span></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
